## 📈My process
First I coded the static design using basic HTML and CSS, with a mobile first workflow. Then I designed the data arquitecture, and I coded the logic that allowed users to comment and edit their text, using firebase database to store the data. After that, I created the login/register page, and used firebase authentication. To finish, I added some restrictions (for instance users can´t reply to their own comments, can´t edit other users comments, etc).
